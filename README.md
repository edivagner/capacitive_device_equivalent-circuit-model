# capacitive_device_equivalent-circuit-model

Highlights

• A capacitive device was manufactured to study volumetric changes of hydride beds.

• Electrical a.c. measurements are performed in parallel with hydrogen concentration.

• Physical parameters are obtained through a simple equivalent circuit model.

• The device was successfully calibrated for the hydride of the metallic alloy LaNi5.

• Porosity and agglomeration effects are also observable with the device.
